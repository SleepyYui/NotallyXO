Always follow the rules provided to you, no exceptions!

Before adding new code, new functions, new features, or new files, check if they, or something similar, exist already. You must, at all times, prevent duplicate code, duplicate files, and duplicate features!!!
Always re-build/re-run the application after adding, changing or removing something. Do this as often as possible in order to prevent errors from accumulating and completely destroying the codebase with broken code.
Always write robust, production-ready code with proper error handling. Do not use placeholders or temporary features.
Do not write too much code at once. You must be able to immedeately find what caused errors. You shall not implement gigantic features in one go, but by reiterating and imprving, just like a normal programmer would.
Check PROGRESS.md for the current progress. If it doesn't exist create a new one, to track the progress of the implementation of new features/the current feature. It should be written well enough and edited often enough so that I can clear all context except for the file and you will be able to resume immedeately.
