/**
 * The instance of LiveData returned by Room only listens for changes while the fragment observing
 * it is alive. Observation of the data stops when the fragment is destroyed and resumes when it's
 * created.
 *
 * Take for example, the following situation
 *
 * User goes to the deleted section User restores 5 notes User returns to the notes section
 *
 * The observation of notes had stopped when the user went to the deleted section and is resumed
 * when the user comes back. This leads to lag and flickering.
 *
 * To stop this, this class acts as a wrapper over the LiveData returned by Room and continuously
 * observes it.
