# Cloud Synchronization Implementation Plan

This document tracks the progress of implementing cloud synchronization in NotallyXO, similar to Google Keep's functionality but with end-to-end encryption and custom server support.

## Overview

The cloud synchronization feature will allow users to:

1. Sync notes with a custom server (specified by IP/Domain and port)
2. Authenticate with a token
3. Encrypt data both in transit and at rest
4. Work offline and sync when connectivity is restored
5. Share notes securely with other users using one-time hash tokens

## Implementation Stages

### 1. Data Model Enhancements ‚úÖ (Completed)

- [x] Create `SyncStatus` enum for tracking synchronization state
- [x] Create sharing-related data structures:
  - [x] `ShareAccessLevel` enum (READ_ONLY, READ_WRITE)
  - [x] `SharedAccess` class for users with access to notes
  - [x] `SharingToken` class for one-time sharing tokens
- [x] Update `BaseNote` class with sync and sharing fields:
  - [x] Added sync fields: `syncId`, `syncStatus`, `lastSyncedTimestamp`
  - [x] Added sharing fields: `isShared`, `sharedAccesses`, `sharingTokens`, `ownerUserId`
- [x] Implement sharing-related utility methods:
  - [x] `createSharingToken()`: Generate one-time hash for sharing
  - [x] `addUserWithToken()`: Add a user using a token
  - [x] `updateUserAccessLevel()`: Change a user's permissions
  - [x] `removeUserAccess()`: Remove a user's access
  - [x] `revokeToken()`: Invalidate an unused token

### 2. Database Migration ‚úÖ (Completed)

- [x] Create Room migration to add sync and sharing fields to the database schema
- [x] Update TypeConverters for new complex data types
- [x] Implement DAO methods for sync and sharing operations

### 3. Encryption Implementation ‚úÖ (Completed)

- [x] Extend existing encryption utilities for cloud sync
  - [x] Leverage existing AES encryption infrastructure
  - [x] Implement master password-based key derivation using PBKDF2
  - [x] Create content encryption/decryption service
- [x] Implement public/private key cryptography for shared notes
  - [x] Generate user keypairs
  - [x] Encrypt shared notes with symmetric key
  - [x] Encrypt symmetric key with each participant's public key

### 4. Settings UI ‚úÖ (Completed)

- [x] Create server configuration screen
  - [x] Server address (IP/Domain)
  - [x] Port number
  - [x] Authentication token input
  - [x] Master password for encryption
  - [x] Auto-sync preferences
- [x] Add sync status indicators
- [ ] Create sharing UI (Pending for future implementation)
  - [ ] Generate and display one-time sharing hashes
  - [ ] Input field for receiving shared notes
  - [ ] Manage shared access (change permissions, revoke access)

### 5. API Client & Networking üîÑ (In Progress)

- [x] Design and implement REST API client
  - [x] Authentication mechanism
  - [x] Note synchronization endpoints
  - [x] User management for sharing
- [x] Implement offline queue system
  - [x] Store pending changes locally
  - [x] Track sync status of notes
- [x] Add basic conflict resolution mechanism
- [ ] Add background sync capabilities with WorkManager

### 6. Backend Implementation ‚è±Ô∏è (Not Started)

- [ ] Create backend server in the backend/ folder
  - [ ] User authentication and authorization
  - [ ] Secure note storage (encrypted)
  - [ ] API endpoints for sync operations
  - [ ] Sharing functionality
- [ ] Implement WebSocket/push notifications for real-time updates

### 7. Conflict Resolution ‚è±Ô∏è (Not Started)

- [ ] Implement conflict detection
- [ ] Create UI for conflict resolution
  - [ ] Show differences between local and server versions
  - [ ] Allow choosing which version to keep or merge
- [ ] Implement automatic resolution strategies (optional)

### 8. Testing ‚è±Ô∏è (Not Started)

- [ ] Unit tests for sync logic
- [ ] Integration tests with mock server
- [ ] End-to-end tests with real server
- [ ] Offline capability testing

### 9. Documentation ‚è±Ô∏è (Not Started)

- [ ] User documentation for cloud features
- [ ] API documentation for server
- [ ] Self-hosting guide for backend

## Current Focus

We've made significant progress on the cloud synchronization feature:

1. ‚úÖ Completed the Data Model enhancements with sharing and sync status fields
2. ‚úÖ Completed the Database Migration to support the new fields
3. ‚úÖ Completed the Encryption Implementation using PBKDF2 and AES/RSA encryption
4. ‚úÖ Completed the main Settings UI for enabling/disabling sync, configuring server, and encryption
5. üîÑ API Client & Networking implementation largely complete:
   - ‚úÖ Created CloudApiClient interface with all necessary endpoints
   - ‚úÖ Implemented CloudSyncService with robust error handling
   - ‚úÖ Added NoteMapper for converting between BaseNote and API DTOs
   - ‚úÖ Implemented core note synchronization logic with proper encryption/decryption
   - ‚úÖ Added support for handling conflicts (currently server wins)
   - ‚ùå Still need to implement background sync with WorkManager

Next steps:
1. Add background synchronization using WorkManager
2. Implement more advanced conflict resolution UI
3. Begin backend server implementation
4. Add unit tests for the sync logic
